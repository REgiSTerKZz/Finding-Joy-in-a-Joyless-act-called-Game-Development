## Information

We had a class in college where we had to make a mini-JAM every few weeks. The game idea was the famous [Marie Kondo](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Kondo) and her method to tidying things. 

In our game, the player has to choose between all the cells to get to all the green ones.

## Game

The player has to get to all the green platforms before he/she runs out of moves.

In the game there are differents types of platforms: <br>
*   **Yellow**: The Start platform from where the player starts the map.
*   **Red**: Once the player step on it, the platform will desapear and the player wil have one movement left.<br>
*   **Green**: Those are the *Goal* to achieve. The player needs to touch all of them in the map. Also this platforms won't disapear after the player steps on them. <br>
*   **Cyan**: The cyan platforms are like a stepping stone, it will not cost the player a move neither will disapear.
*   **Purple**: The purple ones, make reaper all the disapeared platforms untill the moment of stepping the platform.
*   **White**: The white ones change the platforms of the map. The only platforms that do not change are the Start platrofm and the same white platform.
It creates a second map so the player has to take in count both to complete the puzzle.
